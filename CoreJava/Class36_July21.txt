IOStreams:
==========
All input & output related classes are given in "java.io" package.

Stream is a flow of data.

Types of streams:

	1.Character Stream:
		We can perform write & read operations on text related data.
	2.Byte Stream:
		We can perform write & read operations on any type(text/image/video/..) of data.
		
_______________________________________________________________________
1.Character Stream related classes:
==================================

	1.File 				class	: Create directory/folder and files (14 methods)
	2.FileWriter		class	: Write data into file				(write(c/c[]/str))
	3.BufferedWriter	class	: Write data into file				(newLine())
	4.PrintWriter		class	: Write data into file				(print(anytype) & println(anytype)  )
	
	5.FileReader		class	: Read data from file				int 	read()
	6.BufferedReader	class	: Read data from file				String	readLine()
	
Q1.FileWriter Vs BufferedWriter ?
Q2.FileWriter Vs PrintWriter ?
Q3.FileReader Vs BufferedReader ?


Note:
1.Best class for writing data into the file is : PrintWriter
2.Best class for read data from the file is : BufferedReader

2.Byte Stream:
==============

1.FileOutputStream 		class
2.FileInputStream 		class
3.ObjectOutputStream 	class		:  writeObject()
4.ObjectInputStream 	class		:  readObject()

Task1:Copy data from one file to another file
Task2:Read data from file & print
	-> no of vowels
	-> no of digits
	-> no of spaces
	-> no of words
	-> no of lines
Task3:Read 5 student(id,name,marks,age) objects from console & write into the file.
Task4:Read 5 student objects from file & write them into console

1.class Vs interface Vs abstract class
2.exception handling 5 keywords
3.synchronized keyword
