=========================================================
Exception Handling:
===================
Error Vs Exception

1.
	Error is generated at compile time due to improper syntax
	Error cannot handled

2. 
	Exceptions are generated at compile time & run time due to improper logic
Types of exceptions

I.UnChecked Exceptions	(These are not checked by compiler  & checked by interpreter at run time)

	StringIndexOutOfBoundsException
	NullPointerException
	NegativeArraySizeException
	ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
	ArithmeticException
	
II.Checked Exceptions (These are checked by compiler at compile time)

	FileNotFoundException
	InterruptedException
	IOException
	SQLException
	ServletException
	JspException
	
Exceptions can be handled using following 5 keywords

	1.try
	2.catch
	3.throw
	4.throws
	5.finnaly
	
	
	1.try
	2.catch
	3.finnaly
	
	try
	{
		//Write code which monitor the exceptions 
		//Case1:No exceptions 		=> try - finally
		//Case2:Exception is exist 	=> try - first catch
	}
	catch(ExceptionClass1  ob)
	{
		//Write code which handled the exception1 is raised in try block
		//After that control goes to finally block
	}
	catch(ExceptionClass2  ob)
	{
		//Write code which handled the exception2 is raised in try block
		//After that control goes to finally block
	}
	...
	finally
	{
		//Write code which is executed after try & catch block
	}
	

Scenario1:  One exception in try with 1 catch block

Scenario2:  Two exceptions in try with 2 catch blocks

Scenario3:  Multiple exceptions in try with "Exception" class as catch block

Scenario4:  Handling  Multiple exceptions using nested try blocks

Scenario5:  Tracing the exceptions in project using "printStackTrace()" method

Scenario6:  Try with out catch

Scenario7:  Try with out finally

Scenario8:  Netsed catch block

throw  Vs throws:
=================
throw:
------
syntax:

		throw   new  ExceptionClassName();
	
->This keyword throw single object	from try to catch block
->Propagate exception from try to catch block
->Always compiler propagate predefined exception classes automatically.
->For user defined exception class we must use throw keyword
