Q4.Explain Few Thread class methods ?

	1.void run()					:Prepare logic which is being executed by thread
	2.void start()					:It will calls run() method to start it's service
	//SETTERS & GETTERS
	3.String	getName()			:Return the name of thread (Default Names:Thread-0,Thread-1,..)
	4.void      setName(name)		:Change name of thread
	5.int 		getId()				:Return the id of thread which is set by JVM
	6.int 		getPriority()		:Return the  priority of thread(Default priority: NORM_PRIORITY)
	7.void 		setPriorty(priority):Change the prepare to MIN_PRIORITY or MAX_PRIORITY or 1 to 10
	
Q5.Can we execute multiple threads in sequnce ?
Yes,using 8.join() method we can.
	join method holds the current thread execution until it finish it's task & then it goes to dead state.
	9.isAlive() method checks current thread is dead or not
	
Q6.What is data inconistency in multi threading ?
	Or
	What is locking mechanism in multi threading ?
	Or
	Use of synchronized keyword in Java ?

Synchronized in Java:
--------------------
Multi-threaded programs may often come to a situation where multiple threads try to access the same resources 
and finally produce erroneous and unforeseen results. 

So it needs to be made sure by some synchronization method that only one thread can access the resource at a 
given point of time.

Inter thread communication:
---------------------------
To make communication beween the threads "java.lang.Object" class providing following 3 methods

1.wait()
2.notify()
3.notifyAll()

Note:
 All above 3 methods must be used in synchronized area only.

Q7.What is daemon thread & how it works?
They run at background & provide the support for foreground threads
Ex:
	1.GC
	2.Spell checker
	3.Compiler
Note:
By default all threads which are created by user are foreground threads.
To verify current thread is daemon or not we use "10.isDaemon()" method.
"11.setDaemon(boolean)" method used to convert user thread to daemon thread.
