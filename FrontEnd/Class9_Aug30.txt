C language  /  Java language / Python language / C#.Net language / JS language:
===============================================================================
Function 		Method    		Function/Method		Method			Function

Functions:
==========
1.Non-Functional Programming Vs Functional Programming
2.How to prepare a function  / called function?
	function 		nameOfFuntcion(parameters)
	{
			//body function
	}
3.How to use a function / calling function?
	nameOfFuntcion(arguments)
	
4.Parameter Vs Argument ?
	The variables which are present in Called Function is called as Parameter.
	The variables which are present in Calling Function is called as Argument.

5.JS Types:
	1.Internal JS	: Preparing JS functions inside html page 
	2.External JS 	: Preparing JS functions  in a separate file having with .js extension
						Here external js files used by html using <script> tag inside <head> tag.

6.DOM (Document Object Model/Data)

	->Each tag in html file is called 1 object
	->Root tag/object is  : html   => "document" is a object of html class
	->Every document has 1 body & can have multiple p,div,span,b,i,.. objects
	->For uniqueness of document objects we have to give "id" for each object
	-> "innerHtml" 	= 	Text between tags (p,div,span,b,i,...) 
	-> "value" 		=	Text inside <input> tag 
				
7.DOM Manipulation:	
				
	->Decalaration of dom 
	->Set data to dom
	->Get data from dom
	
Note:
	->JS is initially used to perform form validation.
	->JS is also used to perform DOM Manipulation.
	->Because of DOM Manipulation feature, it used in several tech like jQuery,Ajax,Boostrap,angular,angularjs,react,nodejs,expressjs..
